# Grocery Mart Website (Frontend Project)

## Introduction

Grocery Mart is a personal frontend project built to practice HTML, CSS, SCSS, and basic JavaScript skills.

The project focuses on slicing UI from an available design, building a clean layout, implementing responsive design, and organizing source code in a maintainable structure.

This project was developed during my self-study process to prepare for a Frontend Internship.
